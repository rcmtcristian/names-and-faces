## About
My project, MeleeMaven, is a comprehensive resourse for fans of the popular fighting game, Super Smash Bros. Melee. By developing an API and accompanying front end interface, I have made it easy for users to access and explore a wealth of obscure and hard-to-find information about each of the game's fighters. Whether you're a seasoned competitor or just a casual player, MeleeMaven has something to offer for everyone. With My user-friendly interface and extensive database, you'll be able to learn everything there is to know about your favorite Smash Bros. characters in no time.

## Lessons learned
How to undertand more DRY and implement methods to and extent 
With this application, I learned to create a REST API on the server using
Cors and Express. This application pushed to be more creative on how i organized
the object data so that it can be used in a versatile manner, such as when bonding images to ID's, or using tools like Postman to ensure proper routing. Since i was really young i always enjoyed the SSB series and considering all the series characters originated from i strugged finding infomation i wanted which is why i made this site.
