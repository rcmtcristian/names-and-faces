## Lessons learned
How to undertand more DRY and implement methods to and extent 
With this application, I learned to create a REST API on the server using
Cors and Express. I this application pushed to be more creative on how i organized
the character data so that it can be used in a versatile manner, such as when boding images to ids, or when 
using tools like Postman to ensure proper routing.

## Tech

- Cors
- Express
- Html
- CSS
- Javascript


## Node Dependencies
