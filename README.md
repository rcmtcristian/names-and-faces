## Lessons learned
How to undertand more DRY and implement methods to and extent 
With this application, I learned to create a REST API on the server using
Cors and Express. This application pushed to be more creative on how i organized
the object data so that it can be used in a versatile manner, such as when bonding images to ID's, or using tools like Postman to ensure proper routing. Since i was really young i always enjoyed the SSB series and considering all the series characters originated from i strugged finding infomation i wanted which is why i made this site.
